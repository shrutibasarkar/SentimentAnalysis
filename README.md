# SentimentAnalysis
Hashtag based Text processing and Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter data


In this project, I worked on live data using R and Twitter API. I extracted tweets using #coronavirus and #flu. After pre-processing this data, I used the inbuilt sentiment analyzer in R on these tweets with hashtags. Plotted different observations like which has maximum tweets being positive or negative, which has highest fear and anticipation using different data visualizations techniques.
